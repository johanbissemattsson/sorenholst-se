bodyExtra: "## Course content\r\n\nWe start by introducing the basic ideas behind the theory, such as the equivalence principle, how to describe curved spaces and spacetimes in terms of a metric, and the true importance of special relativity as a locally valid theory. Then we use this to study the most important case: the Schwarzschild spacetime, that is, the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution such as a planet, a star or a black hole. \r\n\n\rOnly thereafter we move on to the more mathematical parts of the theory, introducing covariant derivative, the curvature tensor, the stress energy tensor and Einstein's equations. \r\n\n\rWe then discuss some interesting applications of the theory, such as black holes, cosmology and gravitational radiation. \r\n\n## \rCourse literature\r\n\nJames B.

The general theory of relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity. Here he shows that gravity should not be described as a force, as in Newtonian physics, but instead as a consequence of the curvature of space and time. In short, gravity is spacetime geometry. 

This course is about this remarkable discovery: what it means, how the theory can be (and has been) tested, its predictions and consequences.
