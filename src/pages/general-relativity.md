title: General Relativity

![Bokomslag Hartle](/img/hartlecover2.png)

The general theory of relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity. Here he shows that gravity should not be described as a force, as in Newtonian physics, but instead as a consequence of the curvature of space and time. In short, gravity is spacetime geometry. 

This course is about this remarkable discovery: what it means, how the theory can be (and has been) tested, its predictions and consequences.

**Lecutre notes**

Please note that these notes are written primarily for myself as support during the lecture. Their content may therefore not be understandable for someone who didn't attend the lecture. (The first page is usually a summary of the content of the lecture. Green text are things that I say but not write on the board. Pink question marks are things that I may ask during the lecture.)
