subtitle: 'Theoretical Physicist, author and lecturer'
description: >-
  I am a Theoretical Physicist at the Physics Department of Stockholm
  University, [Fysikum](https://www.fysik.su.se/english/). My main interests lie
  within the Theories of Relativity and within fundamentals of Quantum Physics.
  I had my PhD in the spring of 2000 with a thesis within the General Theory of
  Relativity: "Horizons and Time machines - global structures in locally trivial
  spacetimes".

        title: Book on thought experiments in Physics and Philosophy
        description: >-
          My latest book (in Swedish) came in the fall 2012 at Fri Tanke förlag
          (Free Thought Publishers): _Tankar som ändrar allt. Om tankeexperiment
          och nya världsbilder_ (Thoughts that change everything. On thought
          experiments and new world views).


          The book discusses the role of thought experimentation in scientific
          advance, but also the way in which such reasoning can affect our views
          in existential issues. What is time? Do we have an "I" and, in that
          case, what does that mean? Is it always wrong to kill?


          Read more about the book on [the publisher's
          website](http://fritanke.se/bocker/tankar-som-andrar-allt-2/).

        title: Why do thought experiments work?
        description: >-
          How is it possible that one can learn things about the real world by
          performing unrealistic experiments in ones mind? This is an issue
          which has been debated among philosophers. My own thoughts on the
          matter is developed in this article:

          theories](/media/Tankeexperiment-ArtikelTE.pdf)
    title: Thought experiments
    description: >-
      Thought experiments is a common way of reasoning within certain parts of
      Science and Philosophy. In spite of the fact that such arguments often
      involve quite unrealistic scenarios, they turn out to be surpricingly
      useful, not least within Physics.

          My book (in swedish) _Rumtid - en introduktion till Einsteins
          relativitetsteori_ (Spacetime - an introduction to Einstein's Theory
          of Relativity) was published in the spring 2006.


          This book takes a geometrical approach to Special Relativity, and the
          theory is explained using as little mathematics as possible. Click on
          the picture, and you will be directed to the homepage of the book.
          (Also only in Swedish.)

        title: Popular lecture on Relativity (in Swedish)
        description: >-
          What is it that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth, and what
          causes an apple to fall to the ground? A force? Not at all, says
          Einstein. The General Theory of Relativity challenges some of our
          intuitive notions about gravitation, and the nature of space and time.


          The lecture is from March 19 of 2015, and was part in a series of open
          lectures at the Physics Department.

    title: Theory of Relativity
    description: >-
      The Special and the General Theories of Relativity were both formulated by
      Albert Einstein more than hundred years ago, but are still part of the
      foundations of Modern Theoretical Physics.

           Hear are my current courses:

          * ## [Mechanics II (Swedish
          webpage)](https://www.fysik.su.se/utbildning/program-kurser/kursinformation/kursfakta-och-scheman)
            Part of the course "Klassisk fysik (30 hp)" on the Bachelor's Programme. 
          * ## [General Relativity](/general-relativity)
            Master's Programme course about Einstein's important discovery that gravity should not be understood as a force, but rather as a consequence of the curvature of space and time.
          * ## [Summer course in Relativity (Swedish
          webpage)](/sommarkurs-i-relativitetsteori)
            This course explaines the Special Theory of Relativity using a non-mathematical approach. It also provides a short introduction to General Relativity. (This course is not given for the moment.)
          * ## [Thought Experiments in Physics (Swedish
          webpage)](/tankeexperiment-i-fysiken)
            This course examines the role of thought experimentation in the history of Physics, from Galileo to Einstein and onwards. Using the method of thought experimentation as a springboard, we discuss several interesting areas within physics, such as Relativity and Quantum Physics.

        title: STINT Programme for Excellence in Teaching
        description: >-
          The fall of 2007 I spent at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New
          York, paid by the governmental foundation STINT, within their
          'Programme for Excellence in Teaching'. Skidmore College is a
          so-called liberal arts college, and part of the purpose with my stay
          there was to learn more about the liberal arts tradition in the United
          States. I also gave a course in Special Relativity at the Physics
          Department at Skidmore College. 


          Teaching at an American college also provided some interesting
          insights into social life and society. Some of my prejudices were
          confirmed, others were proven wrong. In the report below I comment
          both on my impressions from the college and from the society at
          large.
